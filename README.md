# vFlash

This is a Windows 10 Universal App.

The idea behind this app is that I, along with several people I know, have a better time learning and studying when it's with a partner. I decided to use technology to try and solve the issue of not always having a partner available; thus, vFlash!

The big thing this app provides to users is the voice recognition and TTS capabilities. When reviewing flashcards, users can choose to do an interactive voice review, which uses voice recognition and TTS to help users study.

While the app is still a work in progress and has not been published yet, now that I am finished with school (though I will still be working full time), I hope to complete its first version by the end of June 2017.

Main Features for version 1.0:
Review flashcards using voice recognition and TTS.
Review flashcards in quiz format.
Scoring for each flashcard stack.

*Future Features
Review flashcards via a matching game.
Review flashcards via fill in the blank.
Download flashcard sets from Quizlet.
Share your flashcard stacks publicly with other users.

Potential future features
Record your own voice (or someone else's) for flashcard stacks instead of using TTS.
Teachers: Share classes + flashcards with students via private codes.

That's it for now, but I'm always looking for new ideas and suggestions!
